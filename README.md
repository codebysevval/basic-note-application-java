Simple Java  CRUD project about notes transactions
# 📝 Notes Application (Java Console Project)

This is a simple console-based Notes Application built with Java.  
It allows users to add, remove, update, and list notes using a clean, menu-driven interface.  
I created this project to practice core Java concepts and object-oriented programming.
